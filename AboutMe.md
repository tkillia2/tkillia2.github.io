Hello! My name is Tommy Killian and I will be gradutating from the Unversity of Notre Dame in May of 2023 with my B.S. in Computer Science. In my time here at ND I have had the privilege of being involved and a variety of student clubs and organizations such as CS 4 Good and the Keenan Hall Mentor Program. I have also had the opportunity to be a teaching assistant for a few courses and being a part of the iTReDS second cohort.

As a teaching assistant I had the privilege of working with various students in both the Data Structures of Elements of Computing classes at Notre Dame. Through these experiences I was able to enhance my own knowledge of various concepts while also gaining new skills such as Project Management. Ultimately, being able to work with other students and help them advance their own computing skills was something I really loved to do! Aside from this, I was apart of the iTReDS second cohort which is a new program at the university that allows students to gain relevant Data Science skills and experience by taking classes earlier, encouraing internship work, and partnering the students with another faculty member to work on a final project. Overall, my time at Notre Dame has been truly enjoyable and I cannot imagine going anywhere else, Go Irish!

Upon my graduation I will be joining State Farm as a software engineer. I have spent roughly the past year working for State Farm through both internships and Co-Op opportunitues. Throughout my time there I have been able to work with many talented engineers that have helped me grow as a software engineer. State Farm has helped me learn new skills through AWS, Terraform, CI/CD and more; however, something I am the most excited for is that they offer the opportunity for me to further my education.

Outside of work and school, I have many interests ranging from sports to hiking to videogames. I am a big Chicago sports fan outside of the Cubs (Cardinals fan) and hope that they can find some success here in the future. I have also had the opportunity to do some hiking in many beautiful places including Iceland, Yosemite National Park, the Great Smoky Mountains and more! Finally, I enjoy playing some videogames which can really include anything from an EA Sports title to something solely sold on the Nintendo Switch!

Overall, I am an aspiring software engineer with many interests and hobbies from cloud computing to data science and more. However, I have many interests outside my work as well!
